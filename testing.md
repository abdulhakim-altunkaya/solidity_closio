1) create and deploy WBNB. Mint 1000 
2) create and deploy CSOL. Mint 1000 
3) get some testnet coins on faucets

I am not sure if I can create a WBNB variable with testnet address.  Maybe I can test with mainnet, a simple contract
that returns some values from mainnet WETH on fantom for example.

4) Then deploy closio and set CSOL and WBNB variables.

5) Send some CSOL and WBNB tokens to the contract.

6) Check balances. and test all buttons on the frontend.

7) Check if withdrawAll execution part third "else" can catch some errors. I assume it should catch the any error on smart contract function. If it does, then update witdrawPart and deposit functions accordingly.
