<h1>CLOSIO</h1>

<p>Project prepared by Abdulhakim Altunkaya for BNB Chain Hackathon 2024 March</p>
<p>Project is deployed on BNB mainnet</p>

<p>Closio is a privacy-focused crypto mixing project that allows users to obfuscate the source of their funds and enhance the privacy of their transactions on the blockchain. It provides a secure and decentralized platform for users to mix the WBNB tokens, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of funds.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Closio utilizes a mixing process that combines the funds of multiple users, making it challenging to associate specific funds with their original sources. The basic steps involved in the mixing process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit the Closio website</li>
  <li>Connect to your Metamask account.</li>
  <li>The project is deployed on BNB mainnet. So, make sure you have BNB coins in your wallet.</li>
  <li>Connect your Metamask account to website.</li>
  <li>Click on "CSOL Operations" button and mint CSOL tokens for free</li>
  <li>To let users to test the website, you can deposit TestWBNB tokens instead of real WBNB tokens. To do that, click on "Mint TestWBNB"</li>
  <li>Go to "Mixer Operations" section</li>
  <li>Click on "Approve CSOL". This button will approve the platform for 10 CSOL tokens which is more than you need. Each deposit and withdrawal is 1 CSOL.</li>
  <li>Click on "Approve WBNB". Amount is up you. You better approve more than you plan to deposit.</li>
  <li>Pay the platform fee each time you deposit or withdraw. Each time deposit or withdraw, it is 1 CSOL</li>
  <li>Choose a hard to guess private keyword. This keyword can be alphanumerical word. Save this private word, dont share it with anyone. You will need it, later when you withdraw money. Click on "Create Hash". You will deposit your amount with this hash. This hash is not important you can forget it. Important thing is your private word.</li>
  <li>Deposit the amount with the hash</li>
  <li>Later when you want to withdraw, insert your private word and receiver address. Thats it.</li>
  <li>If you want to withdraw a part of it, you should create another hash for depositing the remaining amount.</li>
  <li>As you can see, to deposit you just need a private word. Later anyone knowing your private word can withdraw any amount to any address. This helps with anonymous transactions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How System works</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CSOL tokens are used to pay a platform fee for depositing and withdrawing.</li>
  <li>Users can create a hash of any private keyword they want. This hash is a product of keccak256 function. When depositing the system will add "salt" to the hash to make the platform very secure</li>
  <li>When withdrawing, you just need to introduce private key and a receiver address.</li>
</ul>
